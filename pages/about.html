	<p class=expl style="margin-bottom:3rem">Hey! I'm a 17 year old high school student from Lexington, Kentucky, who's interested in all things computer science. I've been coding since I was 9, when I would make text-based console games in Java, but since then I've broadened my horizons. I've tried everything from training a neural network to play asteroids, to competitive programming, to making this website. I've worked in Java, Python, C++, PHP, Swift, and now HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. (Sorry to flex)</p>
	<p class=expl style="margin-bottom:3rem">I made this website for two reasons. The first is so I could try out web development by making a static website. The second is because of the lack of accessible information out there on these topics. Many of these algorithms are black boxes to most people; all you have to do is call a method and you're done. I decided it would be interesting to look into how these algorithms work behind the hood and explain it in easily understandable language and visuals, rather than a jumble of pseudocode and mathematical models. I hope you like it!</p>
